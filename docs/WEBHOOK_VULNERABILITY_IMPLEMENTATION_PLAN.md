# Implementation Plan: Missing Webhook Vulnerabilities

## Overview
Based on analysis of the codebase, most race condition and webhook vulnerabilities from sections 6, 7, and 8 are already implemented. We needed to add:
1. Fake Return Confirmation webhook event
2. Fake Refund Confirmation webhook event

## ✅ COMPLETED - Implementation Done

### 1. Updated Webhook Controller (backend/src/controllers/webhook.controller.js)

Added new webhook events:
- `return.approved` - Fake return confirmation
- `return.completed` - Fake return completion confirmation  
- `refund.processed` - Fake refund confirmation
- `refund.completed` - Fake refund completion

These events:
- Trust payload blindly (no verification)
- Allow unauthorized status updates
- Have no replay protection
- Allow duplicate notifications

## Status: ✅ ALL VULNERABILITIES IMPLEMENTED
